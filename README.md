"# Summer-REU-Research" 
To the next PSU student who inherits this code:

The goal of this project is to create a multi-nomial classifier which takes an article url and labels it as either fake, real, satirical, polarized, opinion, misreporting, or persuasive information. (Each type is explained in the explication paper).

Important files:

feature_extraction.py - ArticleVector() will be your best friend this summer. ArticleVector will be how you vectorize an article into its respective features. You can find the features in the fill_vector() class:

classifier.py - This the initialization of the support vector machine. Basically the logistics of data preparation.

validator.py - this will help you validate the accuracy of your model. 

the .txt files are basically all for data collection. Their names should explain their respective uses. 


More importantly, get in contact with me so I can explain everything much more accurately:
